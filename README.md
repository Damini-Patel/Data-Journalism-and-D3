# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3



Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Code this graphic in the `app.js` file and pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
